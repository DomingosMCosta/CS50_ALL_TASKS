First install a c compiler, I used https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

Then run gcc -o tideman tideman.c or directly on the run menu and choose the correct compiler

If tideman.exe already exists then simply run (example) .\tideman.exe Bob Charlie Alice

From here you need to define the number of voters and starts electing people by writing the voter's choice,
by order of preference (every voter instead of choosing just one person, has to give a rank of preferences of all
candidates)
