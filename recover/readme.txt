First install a c compiler, I used https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

Then run gcc -o recover recover.c or directly on the run menu and choose the correct compiler

Before testing, delete all jpg and then try:

If recover.exe already exists then simply run .\recover.exe card.raw

This will recover all the photos from the card
