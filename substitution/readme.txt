First install a c compiler, I used https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

Then run gcc -o substitution substitution.c or directly on the run menu and choose the correct compiler

If substitution.exe already exists then simply run (example) .\substitution.exe mnbvcxzasdfghjklpoiuytrewq

The idea here is for you to provide with a key (26 letters) and that order will become your coder key. Then you simply
have to write a message and the program will codify your message with your given key
