First install a c compiler, I used https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

Then run gcc -o plurality plurality.c or directly on the run menu and choose the correct compiler

If plurality.exe already exists then simply run (example) .\plurality.exe Bob Charlie Alice

From here you need to define the number of voters and starts electing people by writing the voter's choice
